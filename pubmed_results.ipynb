      "Title: Transillumination-Assisted Microdissection for Precise Staging of Seminiferous Tubules in Mice.\n",
      "Abstract: Spermatogenesis, the process of germ cell development into mature spermatozoa, occurs within the seminiferous tubules. It includes mitosis, meiosis, and postmeiotic differentiation phases involving intricate cellular transformations. The seminiferous tubules, comprising 12 longitudinally organized stages of the seminiferous cycle, provide a dynamic environment for germ cell development. At any given stage, the seminiferous epithelium consists of spermatogonia, spermatocytes, and spermatids at a particular point in differentiation. Identifying stages is critical for understanding the dynamic changes of a protein of interest or for evaluating at what point in differentiation a particular gene mutation impacted spermatogenesis. This protocol outlines a transillumination-assisted microdissection method enabling precise staging of seminiferous tubules freshly isolated from mice. This method takes advantage of the unique light absorption patterns along the length of the tubule, as well as the fact that the 12 stages occur in a sequence, allowing for dissecting out each stage. Additionally, the protocol includes immunostaining for the acrosomal marker SP-10 to confirm staging accuracy. While described in the context of mice here, the method is applicable to other animal models and will be particularly useful in evaluating spermatogenesis in mutant mice or those exposed to toxic chemicals.\n",

      "Abstract: Measuring mRNA abundance at the level of the whole transcriptome has become an indispensable tool for the investigation of fundamental biological processes in higher eukaryotes. However, traditional transcriptomic methods are destructive and ignore the three-dimensional organization of cells within tissues and organs. Spatial transcriptomics is a cutting-edge technology that begins to address this limitation and facilitates transcriptomic analyses within the normal spatial context of two-dimensional tissue sections. This method permits a comprehensive appreciation of cellular heterogeneity according to spatial organization and overcomes the critical limitation of traditional bulk methods by preserving tissue architecture. Spermatogenesis is an exemplary cell lineage that varies in a spatial manner. Specifically, the stages of the cycle of the seminiferous epithelium elaborate the cell type variation along the length of seminiferous tubules, which are revealed in two-dimensional space as distinct cellular associations in seminiferous tubule cross-sections. Interpreting the wealth of available single-cell RNA-seq data requires appreciation of cycle stage, which can only be accomplished by understanding each germ cell's spatial context. In this chapter, we provide an overview of spatial transcriptome technologies and step-by-step guidelines for application of one such method from Curio Biosciences, Seeker (SlideSeq V2) to the testis. The text elaborates on testicular tissue preparation and quality assessment, section and spatial transcriptome library preparation, and bioinformatic methods for data analysis using a simple exemplary analysis of round spermatids in the mouse testis.\n",

      "Title: The Efficacy of Intrathecal Platelet-Rich Plasma Administration in Alleviation of Chronic Neuropathic Pain in Rat Model.\n",
      "Abstract: Chronic neuropathic pain (CNP), marked by various stinging sensations, frequently arises from lumbosacral disorders, where astrocytes in the spinal dorsal horn (SDH) significantly contribute to its persistence. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) treatment has shown regulatory effects on astrocytic activity in inflammatory and diabetic neuropathy, yet its impact on CNP remains unclear. This study investigates the potential of intrathecal PRP injections for mitigating CNP in a chronic compressed dorsal root ganglion (CCD) rat model. Animals were divided into CCD, sham, and control groups. PRP or phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was injected intrathecally between the L4-L5 spinal cord. Assessments included mechanical and thermal pain behavioral tests, and in vivo extracellular recordings from the contralateral ventral posterolateral (VPL) thalamus. Additionally, the expression of astrocytic pain mediators in the SDH was analyzed through immunofluorescence. Results showed that the CCD group had significantly lower pain thresholds compared to the sham group. PRP treatment led to improved CNP responses in CCD rats, unlike in the PBS group, highlighting PRP's role in CNP amelioration. Electrophysiology confirmed a notable reduction in VPL thalamic activity post-PRP treatment. Immunofluorescence (IFC) analysis revealed significant increases in neuronal c-fos expression in the DRG and SDH of CCD rats, which were notably reduced following PRP treatment. IFC analysis also indicated decreased expression of pain-transmission-associated astrocyte markers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2), and high mobility group box-1 protein (HMGB1) in PRP-treated CCD subjects. Thus, we demonstrate that PRP attenuates CNP in a CCD rat model by regulating nociceptive input into the spinothalamic tract through the inhibition of astrocytic activity in SDH, presenting itself as a viable therapy for CNP linked to lumbosacral conditions.\n",

      "Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a complex disease influenced by both genetic and environmental factors. Despite advances in understanding PD genetics, subtype-specific mechanisms remain poorly characterized. This study aims to identify distinct genetic markers and pathways across PD subtypes, addressing this gap to enable targeted diagnostics and therapies. Genes associated with PD were collected from various databases and categorized into groups based on the PD type to assess the PD risk. Protein interaction analysis was conducted to identify functional clusters and key genes within each group. KEGG enrichment analysis revealed common genes and pathways among the different PD groups. This study conformed to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines for systematic data collection and analysis. Hub genes such as PRKN, SNCA, and LRRK2 have demonstrated considerable potential as biomarkers for genetic predisposition in PD, alongside the identification of additional complementary genes. Analysis of hub node variants highlighted specific genetic variations in these genes. We identified several microRNAs, including hsa-miR-335-5p, hsa-miR-19a-3p, and hsa-miR-106a-5p, as well as transcription factors that interact with crucial hub genes. This study refines subtype-specific mechanisms for established PD genes and identifies novel genetic markers and pathways associated with juvenile, young-onset, late-onset, familial, and sporadic Parkinson's disease, enhancing our understanding of their molecular mechanisms and potential for targeted diagnostics and therapies. Specifically, we highlight the roles of hub genes, such as PRKN, SNCA, and LRRK2, alongside significant microRNA interactions, which may serve as biomarkers for early detection and personalized treatment approaches.\n",

      "Title: MS275 Inhibits Neuroblastoma Cell Growth by Mediating H3K27ac/PROX1 Axis In Silico and In Vitro.\n",
      "Abstract: Neuroblastoma, a prevalent pediatric solid tumor, is characterized by substantial genetic, morphological, and clinical heterogeneity, which poses challenges to the efficacy of existing therapeutic interventions. Previous studies have demonstrated that the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor MS275 can impede the growth of neuroblastoma cells. However, the precise mechanisms underlying this inhibitory effect remain inadequately understood. To assess the impact of MS275 on neuroblastoma cell proliferation, a series of assays, including CCK8, colony formation assay, EdU assay, cell cycle assay, and apoptosis assays, were conducted. Furthermore, the qRT-PCR, western blotting, luciferase reporter assay, and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays were utilized to elucidate the regulatory relationship between MS275 and PROX1 expression. To further ascertain the role of PROX1 in MS275-mediated tumor suppression, in silico analyses were complemented by the establishment of PROX1 knockdown SH-SY5Y cell lines and xenograft models. The cell functional assays revealed that MS275 exerts an inhibitory effect on neuroblastoma cell proliferation by inducing G1/S cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and autophagy in a dose-dependent manner. Notably, the reduction of PROX1 expression was observed to partially reverse the inhibitory effects of MS275 on neuroblastoma cells, affecting cell cycle progression, apoptosis, autophagy-related factors, and tumor growth. Mechanistically, MS275 was found to significantly enhance and modify the transcription of PROX1 through the induction of H3K27 acetylation. In summary, these findings highlight the crucial role of PROX1 in MS275-mediated tumor suppression and unveil a novel regulatory mechanism involving PROX1, suggesting its potential as a promising therapeutic target for neuroblastoma.\n",

      "Abstract: As a serious complication of sepsis, septic lung injury has a high rate of morbidity and mortality. However, the mechanism of septic lung injury remain unclear. The present study aims to explore the role of succinylation and KAT3B in the polarization of macrophages and the progression of septic lung injury. The cecal ligation and puncture (CLP) was used to establish the septic lung injury model. HE staining was performed to evaluate the lung injury. Raw264.7 cells were treated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to establish the cell model of septic lung injury. Macrophage polarization was evaluated by detecting M1 and M2 markers using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and immunofluorescence. CO-IP was used to investigate the interaction between proteins. The experimental results indicated that KAT3B and the total succinylation was down-regulated in septic lung injury. LPS promoted M1 polarization and inhibited M2 polarization of Raw264.7 cells. KAT3B suppressed M1 polarization and promoted M2 polarization. Mechanistically, KAT3B desuccinylates TSLP at K239 and K292 site and promotes its stability. TSLP silencing reversed the effects of KAT3B. In vivo, KAT3B significantly reduced the lung injury and inflammation response of mice after CLP treatment. The present research unveiled the KAT3B acts as a protector against sepsis induced injury by mediating the succinylation of TLSP.\n",

      "Abstract: Mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC), composed of MPC1 and MPC2, plays a pivotal role in regulating cancer metabolism. While previous studies have implicated MPC1 in tumor progression, the specific function of MPC2 in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) remains largely unclear. In this study, we found that reduced MPC2 expression was significantly associated with advanced TNM stage and poor patient prognosis. Functional assays demonstrated that MPC2 suppresses RCC cell proliferation both in vitro and in vivo. Additionally, concurrent low expression of MPC2 and MPC1 was correlated with significantly shorter overall survival, suggesting their combined prognostic value. Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that both MPC1 and MPC2 are negatively associated with the Bmi1 signaling pathway. Mechanistically, inhibition of the MPC complex-either genetically or pharmacologically-led to increased Bmi1 protein levels by reducing its ubiquitin-mediated degradation. These findings identify the MPC complex as a potential tumor suppressor and prognostic biomarker set in RCC, functioning in part through modulation of Bmi1 stability.\n",

      "Abstract: The facultative parasitic plant Phtheirospermum japonicum forms a specialized organ, the haustorium, to invade its host, Arabidopsis thaliana, establishing a vascular connection via the formation of a xylem bridge. This connection depends on coordinated interactions between the vascular systems of both plants, yet the molecular dynamics of these interactions within the haustorium and the host roots remain elusive. This study aimed to unravel the transcriptomic heterogeneity of haustoria and gene regulatory networks involved in this process by integrating single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing (bulk RNA-seq). snRNA-seq identified a total of 7 P. japonicum cell clusters and 4 A. thaliana cell clusters, each with cluster-specific marker genes, allowing for a distinct characterization of vascular cells within the haustorium. Differential gene expression analyses revealed up-regulation of genes associated with xylem formation and auxin transport in both parasites and hosts, suggesting the presence of shared molecular mechanisms facilitating vascular connection. Further gene network analysis combining snRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq identified conserved homologous genes across both species, indicating potential molecular interactions of vascular-related genes from hosts and parasites. Our study reveals the high heterogeneity of haustorium cells, characterizing the expression profiles of each cell type in haustoria and host roots during haustorium development at single-cell resolution. These findings provide insights into the molecular interactions between parasitic plants and hosts, presenting potential targets for disrupting these interactions to manage parasitic plant infestations in crops.\n",

      "Abstract: Infected pancreatic necrosis (IPN) is a serious and critical complication of acute pancreatitis (AP), often arising in the later stages of the disease. Early detection of high-risk individuals with IPN is essential because it may enable clinicians to implement more efficient management strategies. This review explores the key biomarkers currently used to predict and diagnose IPN. Established markers such as procalcitonin (PCT), C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) play a vital role in detecting infection and inflammation. Non-invasive markers, including corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG), neutrophil CD64 index (nCD64), soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) and human leukocytes antigen-DR (HLA-DR), further contribute to identifying immune suppression and infection risks. While these tools show promise, no single biomarker has proven to be sufficiently accurate. A combination of clinical assessment, imaging and multiple biomarkers is essential for a comprehensive diagnosis. This review emphasizes the need for further research to refine and validate these markers, making them more accessible and reliable for routine clinical use. By advancing our ability to identify IPN early, we can improve patient outcomes and reduce the severe impacts of this complication in individuals suffering from AP.\n",

      "Abstract: The RYR3-DT divergent transcript is a long noncoding RNA overexpressed in gliomas. DNA methylation is frequently perceived as a crucial process associated with epigenetic changes and among the preeminent mechanisms involved in gene inactivation. Ferroptosis is a recently discovered class of cell necrosis and death. Ferroptosis stimulation can potentially eliminate malignancies. RYR3-DT expression and its exact mechanism in glioma remain ambiguous. This investigation found that RYR3-DT was markedly elevated in gliomas. In-vitro functional assays, including Transwell assay, CCK-8, Western blot, and Annexin V assay, revealed that RYR3-DT silencing inhibits glioma cells growth, migration, and invasion, while stimulated cellular apoptosis. Western blot analysis and RNA sequencing proved that RYR3-DT regulated the ferroptosis CoQ10/FSP1 pathway, concluding that lncRNA RYR3-DT deletion might suppress glioma cell growth migrating and invading ability, and also increase cellular apoptosis via CoQ10/FSP1 pathway. Our research recommends lncRNA RYR3-DT is an expected target for future discoveries on glioma treatment.\n",

      "Abstract: The TUBB8 gene is highly conserved in primates, and pathogenic mutations in this gene have been linked to defects in oocyte maturation, leading to infertility in women. This study aimed to identify a mutation in the TUBB8 gene in a family with female infertility and functionally validate the identified mutation to confirm its pathogenicity. Genomic DNA was extracted from the proband's peripheral blood for whole exome sequencing. DNA from the proband's parents was obtained for Sanger sequencing to trace the origin of the proband's mutation. Bioinformatics analysis, conservation analysis, and three-dimensional protein structure prediction were performed on the sequencing results. Wild-type and mutant TUBB8 expression plasmids for the identified mutation sites were constructed and transfected into HEK293T and HeLa cells. Changes in protein structure and gene expression were then assessed. The analysis revealed that the proband carried the TUBB8 mutation c.1039A > G, also present in her father and aunt. This mutation was classified as a Variant of Uncertain Significance (VUS). Protein structure prediction suggested that the TUBB8 p.N347D (c.1039A > G) mutant protein had an additional hydrogen bond compared to the wild-type protein. Still, no significant structural changes were observed in the three-dimensional model. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the TUBB8 c.1039A > G mutation did not disrupt cellular microtubule structure. In vitro assays indicated that the c.1039A > G mutation decreased mRNA and protein expression levels of TUBB8. This study describes a case of female infertility associated with a newly discovered heterozygous c.1039A > G mutation in the TUBB8 gene, which may reduce TUBB8 expression. These findings contribute to the genetic understanding and diagnosis of TUBB8-related diseases.\n",

      "Abstract: Differential domains of activity of MIR394A and MIR394B gene promoters together with transcriptomic analysis of mutant plants, indicate that miR394 participates in the fine tuning of Arabidopsis flower development through regulation of transcription factors and chromatin remodeling factors. The initiation of flowering is a highly coordinated process that requires synchronization of endogenous plant developmental program with environmental signals through a complex interplay of genetic regulatory networks. We had previously demonstrated a role for miR394 in the regulation of flowering time, since mir394a mir394b plants harboring insertional mutations in the two MIR394 Arabidopsis genes exhibited an early flowering phenotype correlated with modified expression of flowering genes. In the present study we provide transcriptomic RNA-seq data and histologic staining of reporter lines to give further insight into the role of miR394 in the regulation of flowering in Arabidopsis thaliana and present an initial bioinformatic characterization of a newly identified lncRNA, which partially overlaps the MIR394B locus, and therefore we named MIR394B-ASSOCIATED TRANSCRIPT (MIRAST). We found that MIRAST expression is generally low and does not differ significantly between Col-0 and mir394a mir394b mutant plants, allowing for the transcriptomic analysis to focus specifically on the role of miR394 in Arabidopsis flowering. We identified 2405 differentially expressed genes, including 13 transcription factors involved in flower organ development and 7 chromatin remodeling factors. Histologic staining of reporter lines further demonstrated distinct domains of expression for MIR394A and MIR394B genes during flower development. Taken together, our results support a role for miR394 in the fine tuning of Arabidopsis flower development, likely through the regulation of key transcriptional and chromatin remodeling regulators.\n",

      "Abstract: Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an acquired autoimmune disorder characterized by impaired neuromuscular junction transmission, leading to fluctuating muscle weakness. With the progressive identification of MG-related antibodies, such as acetylcholine receptor (AChR) antibodies and muscle-specific kinase (MuSK) antibodies, coupled with advancements in antibody detection technology, the use of these diagnostic markers has become widely accessible in clinical practice. This has facilitated the detection of key biomarkers and enabled the study of targeted therapeutic interventions aimed at addressing the underlying production of MG pathogenic antibodies and their various stages of pathogenicity. Among the emerging therapeutic strategies, complement-targeting drugs have garnered significant attention from medical researchers because of their ability to reduce complement activation and inhibit autoimmune-mediated tissue damage. Inhibition of the terminal complement cascade has demonstrated efficacy in reducing disease severity and improving clinical outcomes, particularly in refractory cases of MG. This review summarizes the underlying mechanisms of complement activation in MG, evaluates the current therapeutic landscape, including both approved and investigational complement inhibitors and discusses the safety considerations of their application.\n",

      "Abstract: Hypoxia may facilitate metastasis and tumor advancement in solid tumors. Intratumoral hypoxia may facilitate tumor aggressiveness by stabilizing hypoxia-inducible factor-1α (HIF-1α). Various transcriptional and epigenetic pathways modulate hypoxia-stimulated gene expression and tumor progression. Noncoding RNAs longer than 200 nt are long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). Current lncRNA profiling in several human tumor types revealed that lncRNA expression and deregulation vary by tumor type and may undergo transcriptional, genomic, and epigenetic modifications. LncRNAs controlled by hypoxia have emerged as a prominent focus in hypoxia-regulated biology due to their ability to influence multiple biological procedures associated with tumorigenesis. Hypoxia-regulated lncRNAs may influence tumor development, growth, anti-apoptosis, migration, invasion, angiogenesis, and tumor metabolism. In this light, hypoxia-inducible lncRNAs could interact with protein/protein complex and chromatin/epigenetic factors and another mechanism, thus favoring tumorigenesis. Conversely, lncRNAs may control hypoxia signaling by stabilizing HIF-1α via several mechanisms. Nonetheless, several undiscovered lncRNAs remain that may mediate or regulate the hypoxia axis.

      "Abstract: Integrated transcriptome and metabolome analyses in mustard (Brassica juncea) identified BjMYB90 as a regulator of anthocyanin synthesis and BjGSTF12 as a crucial anthocyanin transport gene The amount of anthocyanin in mustard (Brassica juncea) is critical in determining their purple pigmentation. Anthocyanins are synthesized and transported to vacuoles for storage via Glutathione S-transferases (GSTs). However, the regulatory mechanisms of GSTs in Brassica plants are still unclear. Thus, integrated metabolomic and transcriptome analyses screened GST involved in mustard anthocyanin transport. The metabolome analysis identified a total of 292 metabolites in both green and purple mustard inbred lines. Among these, 21 metabolites were anthocyanins derived from cyanidin and delphinidin, which exhibited differential expressions between purple and green mustard. Through transcriptome screenings, 47 structural genes were discovered (10 PAL, 9 CHI, 6 CHS, 4 4CL, 4 C4H, 4 ANS, 4 UFGT, 2 F3H, 2 DFR, 1 FLS, and 1 F'3H). Moreover, we employed various bioinformatics methods to identify 157 potential full-length BjGST genes from Brassica databases, of which 31 genes were differentially expressed in the transcriptome. Integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses indicated that the BjGSTF12 (BjuA041385) gene involves anthocyanin transport. Furthermore, functional studies showed that BjGSTF12 could restore the purple color in the stem and rosette leaves of the Arabidopsis anthocyanin transport deletion mutant tt19. Additionally, we discovered that the BjMYB90 can bind to the promoter of BjGSTF12, suggesting that the expression of the BjGSTF12 is controlled by various TFs involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. Our findings enhance the understanding of anthocyanin biosynthesis and transport mechanisms and support B. juncea breeding through molecular biology techniques.\n",

      "Abstract: The BRN2 transcription factor controls the protein expression involved in cell motility and is overexpressed in melanoma. Gene mutations involved in cell signaling pathways lead to BRN2 overexpression, tumor formation and metastasis. Peptides derived from the DNA binding domain of transcription factors can compete for the transcription binding and regulate protein expression. In this work, the antitumor activity in vitro and in vivo of the peptide E24G, derived from the DNA-binding POU domain of the BRN2 transcription factor was investigated. This peptide was fragmented into two smaller peptides E12F and A12G, their antitumor activities were characterized and compared with E24G. The E24G at 1 mM significantly reduced cell motility in vitro of B16F10-Nex2 melanoma cells. E12F peptide also inhibited cell motility at a concentration eight times smaller than E24G in murine and human melanoma cells. We observed that the antitumor activity of both E24G and E12F peptides depends on the macropinocytosis displayed by tumor cells. Also, the E24G and E12F peptides induced an increase of the CDH13 expression in 50%, however the treatment with E12F increased the expression already after 12 h by 100%. In vivo assays showed that both peptides reduced the development of metastatic lung nodules without presenting toxicity to normal organs. Our results indicate that E12F and E24G peptides can restore normal expression of BRN2 target genes at the molecular level, inhibiting the cell motility. In addition, we confirmed that the peptide binds to the DNA binding site of the BRN2 transcription factor. Further studies will elucidate their mechanisms of antitumor activity, so far our results pointed out the potential application of E12F and E24G peptides as innovative treatments for metastatic melanoma.\n",

      "Abstract: Periodontitis (PD) and ulcerative colitis (UC) are chronic inflammatory diseases that may share underlying molecular mechanisms, potentially mediated by PANoptosis, which integrates pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Understanding their interaction could unveil novel therapeutic targets. This study aimed to identify key targets and pathways linked to PD and UC, explore the interaction between PANoptosis-related genes and PD-UC-related genes, and predict potential therapeutic targets and drugs for PD-UC. In this study, we acquired datasets from the GEO database, including GSE16134 for PD and GSE87466 for UC. Disease-related targets were identified through differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis. These targets were compared with PANoptosis-related targets and used to form protein-protein interaction networks. Enrichment analyses, such as GO and KEGG, were conducted to investigate the biological significance. Core genes were pinpointed utilizing LASSO and SVM-RFE algorithms, and their expressions were verified in an experimental PD and DSS-induced UC mouse model and single-cell RNA sequencing. A ceRNA network was established, and potential drugs targeting core genes were predicted. Molecular docking simulations were performed to determine binding interactions. As a result, a total of 107 intersected genes were identified, with BAG3, LYN, and APOE recognized as core targets. These genes were significantly associated with immunological processes and inflammatory pathways, as evidenced by enrichment analyses. Histological and molecular validation in mice confirmed their differential expression in PD and UC. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed cell-type-specific expression of core genes, with Lyn enriched in myeloid cells and Apoe in fibroblasts. A ceRNA network highlighted regulatory interactions, while drug prediction pinpointed potential therapeutic agents for LYN and APOE. In conclusion, the study identifies core genes and their molecular networks bridging PANoptosis with PD and UC, underscoring the potential of BAG3, LYN, and APOE as therapeutic targets. These discoveries establish PANoptosis as a novel therapeutic axis for chronic inflammatory comorbidities, bridging the gap between oral and intestinal mucosal immunity.\n",

      "Abstract: Synovial chondromatosis (SC) is a rare joint disorder characterized by cartilaginous loose bodies, yet its cellular underpinnings remain incompletely understood. To define the cellular landscape in SC, single-cell RNA sequencing was performed on synovial tissue obtained from both healthy individuals and SC patients. Analysis of this comprehensive dataset revealed significant alterations in the cellular composition and unique transcriptional profiles of key synovial cell populations within SC synovium. Specifically, a marked increase in the proportion of distinct fibroblast subpopulations (F3 and F4) engaged in extracellular matrix (ECM) synthesis and degradation was observed. Concurrently, the macrophage compartment exhibited a notable shift towards M2-like and M4-like phenotypes. Furthermore, an expanded and dynamically transitioning proliferative immune cell (ProIC) population was identified, with distinct C0 and C1 subpopulations showing unique functional characteristics and a differentiation trajectory from C0 to C1. Beyond individual cellular characteristics, interrogation of intercellular communication networks revealed potentially enhanced signaling, particularly between fibroblasts and macrophages mediated by FTL-SCARA5 interactions, and between macrophages and ProICs via CD74-MIF/other CD74 ligand interactions. These findings offer a comprehensive and detailed characterization of the cellular heterogeneity and altered cellular states associated with SC. This detailed cellular atlas provides a crucial foundation for future functional studies aimed at dissecting the precise roles of these observed cellular alterations in SC pathogenesis and exploring potential therapeutic targets.\n",

      "Abstract: Establishment and maintenance of cellular sex identity is essential for reproduction. Sex identity of somatic and germline cells must correspond for sperm or oocytes to be produced, with mismatched identity causing infertility in all organisms from flies to humans. In adult Drosophila testes, Chronologically inappropriate morphogenesis (Chinmo) is required for maintenance of male somatic identity. Loss of chinmo leads to feminization of the male soma, including adoption of female-specific cell morphologies and gene expression. However, the degree to which feminized somatic cells engage female-specific cellular behaviors or influence the associated XY germline is unknown. Using extended live imaging, we find that chinmo-depleted somatic cells acquire cell behaviors characteristic of ovarian follicle cells, including incomplete cytokinesis and rotational migration. Importantly, migration in both contexts require the basement membrane protein Perlecan and adhesion protein E-cadherin. Finally, we find that sex- converted soma non-autonomously induce expression of an early oocyte specification protein in XY germ cells. Taken together, our work reveals a dramatic transformation of somatic cell behavior during sex conversion and provides a powerful model to study soma-derived induction of oocyte identity.\n",

      "Abstract: AMPK is a master regulator of metabolism and is highly conserved and ubiquitously expressed. Activation of AMPK stimulates the catabolic pathway (glucose utilization and β-oxidation) and inhibits the anabolic pathway (gluconeogenesis, protein synthesis, and lipogenesis), leading to improvement of cellular energy status. However, the mechanisms of maintaining low cellular AMPK activity are not fully understood. We and other investigators showed that activated PKA in the glucagon-cAMP signaling pathway and insulin-activated AKT both can directly phosphorylate AMPKα1/2 at S496/491 to inhibit AMPK activity. In current study, we found that activation of AMPK by an activator AICAR led to elevated and prolonged phosphorylation of AMPKα1/2 at S496/S491, reflecting a feedback inhibition of AMPK activity. In in vitro assay, functional AMPKα1β1γ1 or AMPKα2β1γ1 can phosphorylate AMPKα1at S496 or AMPKα2 at S491, respectively. We designed and successfully screened a new AMPKα2 targeting-peptide to activate AMPK through competitively blocking the negative phosphorylation, resulting in suppression of gluconeogenic gene expression and promotion of mitochondrial fission in hepatocytes.\n",

      "Abstract: Translation initiation in eukaryotes requires a 40 S ribosome loaded with initiator tRNA which scans for an initiation codon. The initiator tRNA is usually recruited to the ribosome as part of a ternary complex composed of initiator tRNA, eIF2, and GTP. Although initiator tRNA recruitment was originally ascribed to another factor, eIF2A, it was later disproven and shown to occur via eIF2. Nonetheless, eIF2A is still considered a translation initiation factor because it binds the ribosome and shows genetic interactions with other initiation factors such as eIF4E. The exact function of eIF2A during translation initiation, however, remains unclear. Here, we use ribosome profiling and luciferase reporter assays to systematically test in HeLa cells the role of eIF2A in translation initiation, including translation of upstream ORFs. Since eIF2A is thought to take over the function of eIF2 when eIF2 is inhibited, we also test conditions where the integrated stress response is activated. In none of our assays, however, could we detect a role of eIF2A in translation initiation. It is possible that eIF2A plays a role in translation regulation in specific conditions that we have not tested here, or that it plays a role in a different aspect of RNA biology.\n",

      "Abstract: Aedes aegypti, a critical vector for tropical diseases, poses significant challenges for studying its embryogenesis due to difficulties in removing its rigid chorion and achieving effective fixation for in situ hybridization. Here, we present novel methodologies for fixation, dechorionation, DAPI staining, and in situ hybridization, enabling the detailed analysis of gene expression throughout Ae. aegypti embryogenesis. By synchronizing eggs at various developmental stages (0-72 h), we localized the transcripts of the gap gene mille-pattes (mlpt), the dorsoventral gene cactus (cact), and the pioneer transcription factor (pTF) zelda (zld). In situ hybridization and RT-qPCR analyses revealed that mlpt and cact are maternally expressed, while zld expression begins zygotically during cellularization and later becomes prominent in neuroblasts. Analysis of previously published transcriptomes suggests that three other pTFs, CLAMP, grainyhead, and GAF, are also maternally expressed and may function as pioneer transcription factors during Ae. aegypti embryogenesis. These findings suggest that the transcription factors responsible for genome activation in mosquitoes differ from those in fruit flies, highlighting significant divergence in the genetic regulation of early Dipteran embryogenesis.\n",

      "Title: Single-Nucleus Transcriptomics Uncovers Xaf1-Driven PANoptosis as a Therapeutic Target in Aminoglycoside-Induced Hearing Loss.\n",
      "Abstract: Aminoglycoside antibiotics are essential in managing many life-threatening diseases. However, their derivatives, such as neomycin, are associated with severe side effects such as persistent sensorineural hearing loss. Therefore, it is essential to elucidate the molecular and biochemical mechanisms of aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity and identify targets for alleviating ototoxic injury. Here, we provide a detailed cochlear cell atlas of neomycin-induced acute and chronic ototoxicity-related changes through single-nucleus RNA sequencing profiling. Utilising this cochlear cell atlas, we used the Augur and scDist algorithms to evaluate cell-type-specific susceptibility to neomycin injury. We observed aberrant expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis (Xiap)-associated factor 1 (Xaf1) in neomycin-exposed cochleae using the cochlear cell atlas, and we identified a novel role for Xaf1 in facilitating PANoptosis through overexpression and knockdown assays in vitro. Finally, we assessed the protective role of Xaf1 against neomycin-induced ototoxicity by Xaf1 knockdown in cochlear hair cells using adeno-associated virus-based gene delivery. Mechanistically, Xaf1 orchestrates PANoptosis activation through direct interaction with and transcriptional regulation of ZBP1, establishing its hierarchical position upstream in the signalling cascade. This study presents detailed cochlear cellular maps of neomycin-induced ototoxicity and serves as a valuable resource for identifying transcriptome-wide disease-driving perturbations at the single-cell level. More importantly, we identified Xaf1 as a critical target for modulating the PANoptosis pathway, offering a promising treatment strategy for aminoglycoside-induced ototoxicity.\n",

      "Title: Telomere-Related Gene Networks in the Ovary Shift Across Environmental Factors.\n",
      "Abstract: The ovary is key to linking environmental factors with the timing and quality of offspring development. Focused on free-living female tree swallows (Tachycineta bicolor), we measured temporal variation in ovarian expression of genes involved in the regulation of telomere length. Using qPCR, we quantified mRNA abundance of shelterin proteins (TERF1, TERF2, TERF2IP, TPP1, POT1), telomerase (TERT), antioxidants (SOD1, PRDX-1, GPX), and glucocorticoid receptors (MR, GR). We asked how they differ across breeding stages and social environments, and then we assessed effects on gene co-expression, which reflects coordinated changes across this network of interacting genes. We hypothesized that maintenance of telomeres is upregulated and more strongly coregulated in the lead up to reproduction, i.e., before egg-laying and following a social challenge. We did not find a main effect of environmental context on mRNA abundance, but we did detect subtle differences in gene co-expression networks. Females exhibited stronger coregulation among shelterin proteins and stronger crosstalk with glucocorticoid receptors during incubation. In response to a conspecific challenger, coregulation of antioxidants with shelterin and glucocorticoid receptors was weaker or more negatively correlated, suggesting semi-independent social modulation of these telomere regulatory networks. While the consequences of these transcriptional differences require more research, our results suggest that the environment could contribute to protection of the ovary, including its telomeres.\n",

      "Title: GATA8-Mediated Antiviral Defence Is Countered by Tomato Chlorosis Virus-Encoded Pathogenicity Protein p27.\n",
      "Abstract: Tomato chlorosis virus (ToCV), a phloem-restricted RNA virus within the genus Crinivirus of the family Closteroviridae, exhibits a broad host range and severely impacts the yield and quality of multiple crops. Viral infection directly alters endogenous phytohormone levels, which are intricately associated with viral mobility, replication, symptom development and defence mechanisms. Previous studies have demonstrated that GATA transcription factors regulate several hormone signalling pathways in plants. In this study, we explored the interaction between ToCV p27 and SlGATA8/NbGATA11. Results indicated that ToCV p27 interacts with an 18-amino-acid at the C-terminus of SlGATA8 and NbGATA11 proteins. Silencing and overexpressing of SlGATA8 revealed its positive role in regulating tomato defence against ToCV infection. Additionally, the interaction redirected SlGATA8's subcellular localisation to plasmodesmata. Furthermore, SlGATA8 promoted the transcriptional expression of SlSnRK2 to regulate the abscisic acid (ABA) signalling pathway. In conclusion, this study confirmed that ToCV p27 impaired the transcriptional activation activity of SlGATA8 through direct interaction, thereby inhibiting the ABA pathway and ultimately facilitating viral infection. This study established a link among virus, GATA family transcription factors and phytohormones, elucidating the molecular mechanism by which ToCV-encoded p27 protein interacts with SlGATA8 to disrupt ABA balance and promote virus infection.\n",

      "Abstract: Lactate is the end product of glycolysis, and extensive research has shown that lactate participates in various pathophysiological processes. Along with associated hydrogen ions, lactate typically functions as an immunosuppressive negative factor and plays a crucial role in tumor metabolic reprogramming. The recently discovered lactylation is a novel epigenetic modification that, similar to other epigenetic modifications, modifies histones to alter chromatin spatial configuration, thereby affecting DNA accessibility and regulating gene expression. More importantly, the degree of lactylation is closely related to local lactate concentrations, establishing a link between epigenetics and metabolic reprogramming. During cellular metabolism, lactate accumulation promotes histone lysine lactylation in cancer cells and immune cells such as macrophages and T cells, playing an essential role in tumor immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy. This paper details the role of lactylation modifications in cancer immune evasion and resistance to immunotherapy, providing novel therapeutic directions and targets for cancer treatment.\n",

      "Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and long-term damage globally. Inflammation is a significant factor in the onset of ischemic stroke. This study investigated the simultaneous administration of melatonin and N-acetylcysteine (NAC) on inflammation in rat cerebral ischemia. First, 30 male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups (n = 6), including the sham group without ischemia, the ischemic group, and the ischemic groups treated with NAC, melatonin, and NAC + melatonin, respectively. To induce ischemia, a silicone-coated monofilament was placed from the common carotid artery towards the middle cerebral artery and stained for 60 min. The rats were treated by administering NAC (50 mg/kg), melatonin (5 mg/kg) and the combination of NAC + melatonin by intraperitoneal injection after ischemia induction. The animals were assessed for sensory-motor activity at 24 and 72 h. Following sacrifice, the rats' brain was dissected to estimate infarct volume after triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining. Inflammatory parameters were then analyzed through gene expression analysis using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) for nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), and nucleotide oligomerization domain (NOD)-like receptor family with pyrin domain 1 and 3 (NLRP1 and NLRP3). The results showed a significant decrease in mRNA expression of the target genes in the rats treated with NAC + melatonin compared to the ischemic group (p < 0.05). The group that received the combined treatment exhibited enhanced sensory-motor function and a reduced brain infarct volume compared to the other groups (p < 0.05). In summary, the combined use of NAC and melatonin has shown promise in enhancing neurobehavioral function and decreasing the volume of cerebral infarction by regulating the inflammatory signaling pathway.\n",

      "Abstract: The objective of this study was to determine the effects of an acute heat challenge on day 4 post-hatch on the transcriptome of several brain nuclei associated with thermal regulation, stress, and appetite. These included the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus, the pre-optic anterior/hypothalamic area (POAH), and the nucleus of the hippocampal commissure (nCPa), in broilers that were subjected to either control incubation conditions or embryonic heat conditioning (EHC). Nuclei were collected at three timepoints relative to the start of heat challenge (0, 2, and 12 h). Total RNA was isolated, and RNA-sequencing was performed. Transcript abundance was quantified, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified, and Gene Ontology analyses were performed. In the nCPa, 469 DEGs were identified across the three timepoints. There were 0 DEGs at hour 0, 2 at hour 2, and 467 at hour 12. Gene Ontology analysis of nCPa samples at hour 12 revealed enrichment in five biological processes, namely, mitochondrial electron transport, mitochondrial respiratory chain complex 1 assembly, synaptic vesicle lumen acidification, protein export from the nucleus, and aerobic respiration. Most of these genes were downregulated, suggesting reduced activity in these processes in EHC chicks. In the POAH, a total of 18 DEGs were identified, with 0, 18, and 0 at hour 0, 2, and 12, respectively. Fewer differences were observed in the PVN, with only four DEGs identified. All four were upregulated in the EHC group, with two involved in hypothalamic thermal responses: vasoactive intestinal peptide transporter 1 (VIPR1) and caprin family member 2 (CAPRIN2). In the nCPa, no differences were detected between hour 2 and hour 0; however, the comparison between hour 12 and hour 2 yielded 9 DEGs. All except one were downregulated at hour 12. The hour 12 vs. hour 0 comparison revealed 49 DEGs, of which 24 were downregulated at hour 12. The results revealed pathways associated with energy metabolism were altered in response to EHC, with most differences in the nCPa. Surprisingly, the fewest differences were observed in the PVN. The findings highlight potential target regions, such as the nCPa, and metabolic pathways that may help better understand how EHC affects stress responses and energy homeostasis later in life.\n",

      "Abstract: Recombinant adeno-associated viruses (rAAVs) produced by transfecting DNA plasmids into mammalian cells can inadvertently package host cell DNA (hcDNA) and plasmid DNA inside their capsids. Although the percentage of these DNA impurities is low compared to the rAAV genome in vector preparations, it is essential to characterize the DNA impurities in gene therapy products due to the theoretical risks associated with unwanted gene expression and potential immunogenicity and oncogenicity in treated patients. We performed long-read sequencing in rAAV vector, with a focus on analyzing residual, non-transgene DNA within the capsids. Although we detected host cell and residual plasmid DNA impurities, they were predominantly incomplete sequences without coding potential. This indicated that while DNA impurities may be present in rAAV preparations, host cell and residual plasmid genes were unlikely to be expressed. This was supported by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analyses that showed minimal plasmid RNA transcripts and host cell RNA transcripts in the livers of mice dosed with rAAV. Overall, the results from these studies enable data-based risk assessment of co-packaged DNA impurities and a better understanding of potential adverse effects associated with rAAV gene therapy.\n",

      "Abstract: Fluorescence molecular imaging (FMI) is a powerful imaging technique used primarily in biomedical research and clinical applications to visualize molecular and cellular processes of tumors and other diseases. FMI involves the use of fluorescent molecules (fluorophores) that absorb light at one wavelength and emit it at a longer wavelength. These fluorophores can be attached to specific molecules and markers (such as proteins, nucleic acids, or small molecules) in a biological sample. FMI typically offers non-radioactive and safe, real-time and higher spatial resolution compared to positron emission tomography (PET) for superficial tumors. Additionally, sensitivity and specificity of FMI for superficial tumors in better than PET is some cases. However, FMI and the materials used in molecular imaging (MI) have revolutionized biomedical research, diagnostics, and therapeutic monitoring. In contrast, despite their significant contributions, several challenges remain to be solved to improve the effective application of fluorescence-based techniques. These challenges are related to poor tissue penetration depth, background autofluorescence, photobleaching of fluorophores, low signal-to-noise ratio in deep tissues and the necessity for biocompatible and photostable probes. Hence, ongoing improvements in probe development, imaging technologies and analytical methods are required to overcome current challenges. Future advancements in fluorescence materials and imaging techniques hold promise for making MI more accurate, efficient and applicable for clinical and research scenarios. This review gives an overview of recent advances in the materials used in MI and findings of FMI. Finally, limitations of FMI are highlighted and recommendations for future research directions are proposed.\n",

      "Title: Neurobiomarkers for Traumatic Brain Injury: Comparison of Serum Values Within 24 Hours of Injury With Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) Scores in a Prospective Cohort Trial.\n",
      "Abstract: Objective Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a significant cause of morbidity, disability, and mortality across all age groups, presenting both health and socioeconomic challenges globally. Neuroimaging techniques are crucial for assessing TBI, but their availability is often limited. Investing in point-of-care blood biomarkers, such as neurofilament light (NFL) protein and S100 calcium-binding protein B (S100B), may offer more accessible and reliable information on neuronal injury, assisting in clinical evaluation without compromising sensitivity. The objective of this study was to correlate the serum values of NFL and S100B with the severity of TBI as assessed by the Glasgow coma scale and to evaluate the potential of these markers for early prognostication. Methods A total of 92 TBI patients, categorized into mild (30), moderate (28), and severe (34) cases, admitted to Nizam's Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India, from 2019 to 2020, were enrolled. Serum levels of NFL and S100B were measured within 24-36 hours of injury for all participants. Results NFL concentrations were 51.1±12.13, 99.9±31.55, and 251.68±78.28 pg/mL for mild, moderate, and severe TBI patients, respectively. S100B concentrations were 193.47±76.57, 542.9±158.78, and 1882.6±824.8 pg/mL for mild, moderate, and severe TBI patients, respectively. Significant differences were observed in NFL and S100B levels when compared between the groups (p<0.05). On day 0, the values of NFL (p≤0.001) and S100B (p=0.023) were significantly higher in non-survivors compared to survivors in severe TBI. S100B showed AUCs of 0.98 (mild), 0.93 (moderate), and 0.99 (severe); NFL showed AUCs of 0.21, 0.51, and 0.28, respectively. The odds ratio (OR) for S100B in mild TBI was 1.07 (95% CI: 1.00-1.14); all other ORs were close to 1 with 95% CI including 1. Conclusion S100B showed strong diagnostic performance across TBI severities, while NFL demonstrated limited utility based on low AUC values and non-significant ORs. These findings support the use of S100B as a more reliable biomarker for TBI assessment.\n",

      "Abstract: The investigation of serum amyloid A (SAA), IL-6, and IL-8 concentrations in serum during episodes of clinical and subclinical mastitis is of significant value. The objective of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of Serum Amyloid A (SAA), IL-6, and IL-8 in the early detection of subclinical mastitis in cows infected with Escherichia coli (E. coli) and staphylococcus infections. This cross-sectional analytical study, conducted in 2023 at the Veterinary Laboratory in Urmia, Iran, evaluated inflammatory markers in 79 dairy cows with clinical and subclinical mastitis. The cows were divided into three groups: healthy cows, cows with subclinical mastitis, and cows with clinical mastitis. Each of these groups was then evaluated for Serum Amyloid A (SAA), IL-6, and IL-8. The diagnostic value of the inflammatory markers was determined by calculating the areas under the curves (AUCs) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In general, among patients with a positive culture test result (57%), 19% were found to be infected with E. coli, 22.8% with Streptococcus uberis, and 15.2% (12 cases) with Staphylococcus aureus. A strong correlation was observed between the mean SCC and the values of IL-6 (P<0.005), IL-8 (P<0.005), and SAA (P<0.005). Furthermore, a strong correlation was observed between SAA and IL-8 (P<0.005). The value of IL-6 exhibited a moderate correlation with both IL-8 (P<0.005) and SAA (P<0.005). The sensitivity and specificity of SCC (0.98), SAA (0.90), IL-6 (0.95), and IL-8 (0.87) were high for the diagnosis of mastitis in cows. The present study demonstrated that mastitis in dairy cows is associated with an increase in inflammatory cytokines, including amyloid A, IL-6, and IL-8. The findings of this study indicate that fluctuations in these biomarkers may serve as a potential indicator for disease diagnosis.\n",

      "Abstract: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a significant pathogen responsible for nosocomial infections. P. aeruginosa is a multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacterium that is postulated to be the result of its plasmid-borne and intrinsic resistance to a number of pharmaceutical agents. This study examined the potential for biofilm formation, the distribution of the pslD, pelF, and algD genes, and the expression of the MexAB-OprM efflux pump genes. Furthermore, the study examined the pattern of antibiotic resistance in multi-drug resistant P. aeruginosa isolates obtained from a range of clinical samples. A total of 76 strains of P. aeruginosa were obtained for this investigation from a range of clinical specimens. The susceptibility of the isolates to antibiotics was evaluated using the disk agar diffusion method. In conclusion, the term \"multi-drug resistance\" (MDR) is used to describe a specific pattern of resistance. The isolates were evaluated for the presence of three pivotal biofilm genes and their antimicrobial resistance patterns against ten standard antibiotic disks. The data were analyzed using version 25 of the SPSS statistical software. The examination of the isolates revealed that the most antibiotic sensitivity was associated with polymyxin, piperacillin, and ciprofloxacin. Additionally, the prevalence of biofilm-producing genes, specifically pslD, pelF, and algD, was determined to be 68.4%, 80.3%, and 69.7%, respectively. The prevalence of MexAB-OprM efflux genes in the examined isolates was 89.5% for the mexA gene, 90.8% for the mexB gene, and 90.8% for the oprM gene. The majority of the isolates in this investigation exhibited the presence of efflux pump genes, as evidenced by the findings. Furthermore, a robust correlation was identified between a select number of efflux genes and biofilm formation or the antibiotics tetracycline, meropenem, amikacin, and polymyxin B.\n",

Relevant research in the field involves gene expression, inflammatory regulation mechanisms, host-microbial interactions, as well as disease resolution and healing processes. Research methodology in the field falls under 2 categories-periodontal inflammation models and surgical defect models. The former simulates periodontal defects by inducing periodontal diseases, while the latter constructs clinically simulated periodontal defects through surgical removal of periodontal tissue. However, the currently available animal models of periodontitis face challenges in simultaneously capturing the disease complexity, tracking dynamic repair processes, and meeting translational needs. Herein, we reviewed and summarized the methods and characteristics of periodontal disease modeling in recent years.
